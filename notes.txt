assumptions:
- assumes channel names and bundle identities are in *.ncs files
	- assumes neuralynx: NCSFiles = struct2table(dir('*.ncs'));
	- assumes channel name is findable from ncs files
	- assumes bundle identity is findable from ncs files
- assumes fixed format of spikes and times file names
	- spikefile = sprintf('CSC%d_spikes.mat',channels(chan));
	- timesfile = sprintf('times_CSC%d.mat',channels(chan));
	- instead of having the filename be part of spikeInfos
- assumes threshold field name: load(spikefile,'threshold_all')
	- instead of load(spikefile,'threshold')

- assume we are given a list of structs, where each entry has the time filename, the spikes filename, the channel name, and the bundle number
